# Statistician-Class
Creating a Statistician C++ Class

This project was part of my Data Structures class.  The purpose of this project was to create a C++ class called Statistician.  A Statistician object keeps track of specific statistics on a series of numbers.  Functions allow access to various properties such as the: mean, min / max values, length.  In addition to functions the equality operator  (==) has been overloaded to compare to Statistician objects.  The (+) operator combines properties of two Statistician objects creating a third object with the properties of the other two.  The multiplication operator (*) multiplies a statistician object by a scalar value
